# Amazon Bookmarklet 2

Bookmarklets for Amazon.co.jp to get a simple link (with/without its title, with/without your affiliate ID).

This is better version of [sky-y/amazon-bookmarklet-summary](https://github.com/sky-y/amazon-bookmarklet-summary)

## For developers

1. Install the dependencies via package.json
2. Edit the package.json and change the settings
3. Run `gulp`
4. Add bookmarklet.js to your bookmark folder
5. Just develop your js in the folder you assigned to ("src folder") and reload the browser.
6. When you finish the development, you can get the source from the folder you assigned to ("dest folder")
